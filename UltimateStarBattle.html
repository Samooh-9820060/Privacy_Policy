        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>We respect the privacy of the users of Ultimate Star Battle. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our app.</p>
        <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the app.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>Ultimate Star Battle requires certain information for a better experience during online gameplay. The information is saved automatically when you sign in with Google and includes details such as your email, username, and profile picture. This information is used to identify you during games and enhance your user experience.</p>
        <p>The game uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Sign-In:</strong> We use Google Play Sign-In to authenticate users for online play. This process automatically saves certain information (email, username, profile picture) from your Google account to the Firebase Firestore. This is used for identification and to enhance user experience in the game, but it is not shared with other parties by us.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Firestore:</strong> Firestore is used to store online game data, enabling users to play against each other. The data saved here is only used for game functionality and is not used or shared for any other purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Our app displays advertisements via Google AdMob, to offer the game for free. These ads may be tailored to your interests or location. For more information on how your data is used in this context, and how to opt out, please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ads and Analytics</h2>
        <p>Our app displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob, which may be personalized based on your interests, user location, and other criteria. While we do not directly collect analytics data, third-party services involved in the operation of our app, such as Google, may collect information related to your use of the app. This helps us understand app usage patterns and improve the user experience.</p>

        <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
        <p>Our app offers push notifications to notify you when a player joins your game or makes a move. We use Firebase Cloud Messaging to deliver these notifications. By using this feature, you grant us permission to store a token which is used to send you push notifications, but this token does not identify you personally. You can manage your notification preferences or deactivate them at any time through the app's settings.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Your interaction with Google Play services and Firebase Cloud Messaging is subject to Google's Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Data Deletion Request</h2>
        <p>If you wish to have your account and associated data deleted, please submit a request through our <a href="https://forms.gle/spPnJzpw7Cm4LxKV6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Deletion Form</a>. We will process your request in accordance with our data protection and privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may occasionally update our Privacy Policy. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
