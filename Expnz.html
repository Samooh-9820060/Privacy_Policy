        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>Expnz is a personal finance management app that requires users to enter data in the form of transactions, accounts, and categories. To enhance user experience, the app sends notifications to remind users of upcoming or overdue transactions based on the data they provide. Users can manage these notifications in the app settings.</p>
        <p>To use the app, users need to sign in with their email and password, and create a profile including their name, email, and mobile number. A profile picture is optional. All data entered by the user is stored in Firestore and is not subject to analytics. We use notifications to improve the functionality and user experience of the app, and no personal data is shared or used for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>Account Registration</h2>
        <p>Users are required to register an account to access the app's features. This process involves providing an email address, name, and mobile number. Or users can use Google Sign-In as well.</p>

        <h2>Data Management</h2>
        <p>Users have control over their data within the app and can modify or delete their transactions, accounts, and categories. For bulk data deletion requests, users can submit a request through our <a href="https://forms.gle/2dNGf7piheVecmJD7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Deletion Form</a>.</p>

        <h2>Notification Access and Settings</h2>
        <p>In addition to allowing Expnz to read notifications for adding temporary transactions, the app also sends out notifications to remind users of their financial activities. This feature includes reminders for upcoming transactions, overdue payments, and other important alerts related to users' financial management. Users have full control over the notification settings and can opt in or out of these reminders at any time within the app settings.</p>
