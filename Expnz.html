        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>We respect the privacy of the users of Expnz. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our app.</p>
        <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the app.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>Expnz is a personal finance management app that requires users to enter data in the form of transactions, accounts, and categories. To enhance user experience, the app sends notifications to remind users of upcoming or overdue transactions based on the data they provide. Users can manage these notifications in the app settings.</p>
        <p>To use the app, users need to sign in with their email and password, and create a profile including their name, email, and mobile number. A profile picture is optional. All data entered by the user is stored in Firestore and is not subject to analytics. We use notifications to improve the functionality and user experience of the app, and no personal data is shared or used for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>Ads and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Expnz integrates advertisements within the app to support development and maintenance costs. Ads are delivered through third-party ad providers such as Google AdMob. These providers may use cookies or similar technologies to display relevant ads. While ads are displayed, no personal data entered into the app (such as transaction details, accounts, or categories) is shared with these providers.</p>
        <p>For more information on how third-party ad providers collect and use data, refer to their respective privacy policies. Users can opt-out of personalized ads by managing their preferences in the device settings.</p>

        <h2>Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information. This includes encryption protocols and secure storage mechanisms to safeguard data against unauthorized access or exposure.</p>

        <h2>Account Registration</h2>
        <p>Users are required to register an account to access the app's features. This process involves providing an email address, name, and mobile number. Users can also opt to use Google Sign-In for added convenience.</p>

        <h2>Data Management and Retention</h2>
        <p>Users have control over their data within the app and can modify or delete their transactions, accounts, and categories. For bulk data deletion requests, users can submit a request through our <a href="https://forms.gle/2dNGf7piheVecmJD7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Deletion Form</a>. User data is retained for as long as the account is active or as needed to provide services, after which it will be deleted following the userâ€™s request.</p>

        <h2>Notification Access and Settings</h2>
        <p>Expnz runs in the foreground to detect and save notifications related to financial transactions, even when the app is closed. This ensures temporary transactions are stored locally for user configuration. The app also sends out notifications to remind users of their financial activities, including upcoming and overdue payments. Users have full control over these notifications and can manage their preferences in the app settings.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Expnz uses Firestore for data storage but does not use any external analytics services. No personal data is shared with third parties or used for any other purpose outside the app. If additional services are integrated in the future, we will update this policy accordingly.</p>

        <h2>Compliance and User Rights</h2>
        <p>We comply with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR and CCPA, to ensure user privacy rights are respected. Users have the right to access, rectify, or request the deletion of their data. For further assistance, please contact us at the provided email.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may occasionally update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. We recommend that users frequently check this Privacy Policy for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.</p>
